Description:  R implementation of the family of Generalised Age-Period-Cohort 
    stochastic mortality models.  This family of models encompasses many models 
    proposed in the literature including the well-known Lee-Carter model, 
    CBD model and APC model. It includes functions for fitting mortality models,
    analysing their goodness-of-fit and performing mortality projections and 
    simulations.
