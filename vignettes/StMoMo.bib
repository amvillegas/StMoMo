abstract = {The Lee-Carter method of mortality forecasting assumes an invariant age component and most applications have adopted a linear time component. The use of the method with Australian data is compromised by significant departures from linearity in the time component and changes over time in the age component. We modify the method to adjust the time component to reproduce the age distribution of deaths, rather than total deaths, and to determine the optimal fitting period in order to address non-linearity in the time component. In the Australian case the modification has the added advantage that the assumption of invariance is better met. For Australian data, the modifications result in higher forecast life expectancy than the original Lee-Carter method and official projections, and a 50 per cent reduction in forecast error. The model is also expanded to take account of age-time interactions by incorporating additional terms, but these are not readily incorporated into forecasts.},

abstract = {Our first paper reviewed methods for modelling variation in cancer incidence and mortality rates in terms of either period effects or cohort effects in the general multiplicative risk model. There we drew attention to the difficulty of attributing regular trends to either period or cohort influences. In this paper we turn to the more realistic problem in which neither period nor cohort effects alone lead to an adequate description of the data. We describe the age-period-cohort model and show how its ambiguities surrounding regular trends 'intensify'. We recommend methods for presenting the results of analyses based upon this model which minimize the serious risk of misleading implications and critically review previous suggestions. The discussion is illustrated by an analysis of breast cancer mortality in Japan with special reference to the phenomenon of 'Clemmesen's hook'.},

abstract = {Many common models of mortality can be expressed compactly in the language of either generalized linear models or generalized non-linear models. The R language provides a description of these models which parallels the usual algebraic definitions but has the advantage of a transparent and flexible model specification. We compare eight model structures for mortality. For each structure, we consider (a) the Poisson models for the force of mortality with both log and logit link functions and (b) the binomial models for the rate of mortality with logit and complementary log–log link functions. Part of this work shows how to extend the usual smooth two-dimensional P-spline model for the force of mortality with Poisson error and log link to the other smooth two-dimensional P-spline models with Poisson and binomial errors defined in (a) and (b). Our comments are based on the results of fitting these models to data from six countries:Australia, France, Japan, Sweden, UK and USA. We also discuss the possibility of forecasting with these models; in particular, the introduction of cohort terms generally leads to an improvement in overall fit, but can also make forecasting with these models problematic.},

@article{Hobcraft1982,
abstract = {This paper considers only the vital events of demographic measurement, the factors influencing the rate at which those events occur and then investigates the consequences of patterns of these events. It reviews the state of the art of age, period and cohort analysis for demographic dependent variables. Major examples of such analyses are given in both mortality and fertility studies. In the area of mortality the conventional approach to such analysis apears to be well suited to a wide range of applications yielding useful results. The reasons for this suitability are: early childhood experience is important in many major disease and death processes, so that cohorts are legitimately viewed as acquiring early on a certain fixed susceptibility; data sometimes stretch back far enough that stationary standards of age patterns can be developed empirically, and applied to later experience; and, logarithmic or logistic transformations linearize comparisons of age schedules or mortality so that standard statistical procedures are suitable. Applications of age, period, and cohort analysis are not always routine; external constraints are required, in the form of theoretically based and mathematically expressed age patterns of mortality, in order to distinguish effectively between period and cohort effects. A set of models of age patterns of mortality that are based on cohort as well as period experience could be constructed with useful applications. With fertility analysis the conventional approach is much less suitable. Once goal directed behavior is introduced, empirical examinations must be based on theories or assumptions about how such goals are formulated and pursued. Conventional analysis might suffice only if one is prepared to accept the assumption that all pertinent goals and strategies are formulated before the initiation of childbearing and remain unaffected by subsequent events. This assumption is untenable for modern developed populations and the forms of analysis appropriate to age period cohort investigations of fertility will have to develop along with theories of reproductive behavior.},

True e0 was within the ex ante 95{\%} probability interval 97{\%} of the time overall, but intervals were too broad up to 40 years and too narrow after 50 years. Projections to 1998 made after 1945 always contain errors of less than two years. Hypothetical projections for France, Sweden, Japan, and Canada would have done well. Changing age patterns of mortality decline over the century pose problems for the method.},

abstract = {Background Long term dialysis is life-saving for patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). However, in ESRD patients with multiple comorbid conditions, dialysis may actually be futile, and conservative management is advisable. We studied the life expectancy of Chinese ESRD patients treated conservatively. Methods We reviewed 63 consecutive ESRD patients who were treated conservatively in our center. Duration of survival was computed from the date of initial assessment for dialysis, as well as the expected date of needing dialysis based on previous trend of renal function decline. Results At the end of the observation period, 55 patients died. Twelve patients died before the expected date of needing dialysis because of unrelated reasons, while 36 deaths were directly attributed to uremia. The median overall survival after initial assessment for dialysis was 41.3 months (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 33.2 to 49.4 months). The median overall survival was 6.58 months (inter-quartile range, 0.92 to 9.33 months) from the theoretical date of needing dialysis. The survival from the theoretical date of needing dialysis did not correlate with patient age, sex, diabetic status, or baseline renal function. Conclusions In Chinese ESRD patients treated conservatively, the median survival is around 6 months after the theoretical date of needing dialysis. Our result provides an important piece of information for the decision of dialysis and patient counseling.},

@article{Osmond1985,
abstract = {A description of a table of age- and period-specific mortality rates may be provided by the use of age, period and cohort models. These may be extended to produce estimates of future mortality rates that allow for trends related to both birth cohort and period of death. Lung cancer mortality rates for women in England and Wales are used as an example. The period 1951-70 is used to estimate mortality rates for 1971-80 and comparisons are made with the observed values. The technique is then used to estimate mortality rates until the year 2000 based upon 1951-80. The range of conditions for which this method is appropriate is discussed.},

@article{Currie2006a,
abstract = {Data with an array structure are common in statistics, and the design or regression matrix for analysis of such data can often be written as a Kronecker product. Factorial designs, contingency tables and smoothing of data on multidimensional grids are three such general classes of data and models. In such a setting, we develop an arithmetic of arrays which allows us to define the expectation of the data array as a sequence of nested matrix operations on a coefficient array.We show how this arithmetic leads to low storage, high speed computation in the scoring algorithm of the generalized linear model.We refer to a generalized linear array model and apply the methodology to the smoothing ofmultidimensional arrays.We illustrate our procedure with the analysis of three data sets: mortality data indexed by age at death and year of death, spatially varying microarray background data and disease incidence data indexed by age at death, year of death and month of death.},
