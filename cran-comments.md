## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have
added in the DESCRIPTION relevant references to the
methods implemented in the package. There is no reference
available for the family of generalised age-period-cohort
as this is a new framework we introduced for this package, 
but I have addedd references to the Lee-Carter and
Cairns-Blake-Dowd models.
